So I started keeping a diary in second grade. It measured around 7 cm in height and 5 cm in width. I wasn't sure what to do with it, so I used it as a personal jotter.

## A Diary is not a Journal

Many of us make the mistake of thinking the two are the same. No, they aren't. They all serve different purposes, and therefore, they are not all the same. 
A diary, according to Wikipedia is:

> A diary is a record (originally in handwritten format) with discrete entries arranged by date reporting on what has happened over the course of a day or other period. A personal diary may include a person's experiences, thoughts, and/or feelings, excluding comments on current events outside the writer's direct experience.

And a journal, according to Google, is:

> 1. A newspaper or magazine that deals with a particular subject or professional activity.
> 2. A daily record of news and events of a personal nature; a diary.

It is both complicated and easy. A diary is a book in which events are recorded as they happen, whereas a journal is a book in which ideas are explored. A journal generally contains random ideas, lists, and subjects. It isn’t formatted like a diary.

## When I started using diaries again

I was bored at home after finishing junior high school, so I turned to viewing seasonal movies. [The Vampire Diaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vampire_Diaries) was one of them. It was about two best friends, one of whom had to be in a coma and would not wake up until the other died, so the best friend who was alive kept a diary of everything that happened so that when she died and her best friend awoke, she would know all that had happened.

## Taking pre-cautions

One of the numerous reasons people avoid writing in diaries is the worry that their secrets will be revealed. Yes, it's awkward when a friend picks up your diary and discovers your secrets. As a result, I resolved to take precautions. I knew my diary could go missing, and I didn't want any stranger to read my sensitive information.

So after careful thinking, I decided to encrypt it. Well, that’s the only possible way to keep someone from reading, even if they steal your diary. After careful consideration, I decided to learn the [PigPen cypher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigpen_cipher). This cypher is very easy to memorize as each letter is replaced by a symbol. So after learning it for a few days, I decided to use it in my diary.

## My first diary entry

So, after learning the Pig-Pen cypher, I never tried it in my diary. I wanted to become comfortable with it before writing in my diary. I did not want to make my diary dirty by cancelling all the time. The first time I made an entry was on January 6th, 2020. That was the second day after I went to school. I was too tired to write on the 5th, so I decided to write the next day as well. I didn’t write anything sensible the first day; I was just itching to start using my diary. One good advantage of the Pig-Pen cypher is that you can always change the pattern of the letters. If you were to use the cheat sheet above, you wouldn’t be able to decode all the letters.

## Wrapping up...

Well, I think it is very useful to have a diary. There are many advantages to using a diary. It helps to improve your memory. Imagine reading your childhood diary when you are grown.

If you don’t have one, it would be a great idea to get one and start writing. Who knows, you could become the next [Anne Frank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Frank).
